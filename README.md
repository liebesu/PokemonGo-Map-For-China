# PokemonGo Map![Python 2.7](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7-blue.svg)


Live visualization of all the pokemon (with option to show gyms and pokestops) in your area. This is a proof of concept that we can load all the pokemon visible nearby given a location. Currently runs on a Flask server displaying Google Maps with markers on it.

Features: 

* Shows Pokemon, Pokestops, and gyms with a clean GUI.
* Notifications 
* Lure information
* Multithreaded mode
* Filters
* Independent worker threads (many can be used simulatenously to quickly generate a livemap of a huge geographical area)
* Localization (en, fr, pt_br, de, ru, zh_cn, zh_hk)
* DB storage (sqlite or mysql) of all found pokemon
* Incredibly fast, efficient searching algorithm (compared to everything else available)
